This is a web-based utility for converting Excel files to PDF documents. Users can upload an Excel file, view its contents in an interactive table, edit the data directly in the browser, and then export the final table as a PDF. The application features a modern, dark-themed interface with drag-and-drop functionality.

## Features

- **Excel File Upload**: Supports uploading `.xlsx` and `.xls` files via a drag-and-drop zone or a traditional file selector.
- **Interactive Data Table**: Displays the content of the first sheet from the uploaded Excel file in an editable data grid powered by Material-UI.
- **In-Browser Editing**: Allows users to modify cell data directly within the table. Changes are saved instantly.
- **PDF Export**: Generates and downloads a PDF of the table data, including any edits made, using jsPDF.
- **Persistent State**: Uses browser `localStorage` to save the table data, so your work is not lost if you refresh the page.
- **Modern UI**: Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, featuring a responsive layout, a sleek dark theme, and subtle animations.
